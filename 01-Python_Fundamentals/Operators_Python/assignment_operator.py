# Assignment Operator 

# Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables. This operator is used to assign the value of the right side of the expression to the left side operand.

a=32            # "=" is an assignment operator 
print(a)


# Addition Assignment Operator 
print("Addition Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a + b
a += b

# Output
print(a)

 

# Subtraction Assignment Operator
print("Subtraction Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a - b
a -= b

# Output
print(a)



# Multiplication Assignment Operator
print("Multiplication Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a * b
a *= b

# Output
print(a)



# Division Assignment Operator
print("Division Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a / b
a /= b

# Output
print(a)




# Modulus Assignment Operator
print("Modulus Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a % b
a %= b

# Output
print(a)




# Floor Division Assignment Operator 
print("Floor Division Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a // b
a //= b

# Output
print(a)





# Exponentiation Assignment Operator
print("Exponentiation Assignment Operator : ") 

a = 3
b = 5

# a = a ** b
a **= b

# Output
print(a)
