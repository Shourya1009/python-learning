# this is a single line comment
print("Hello World!") 

# shortcut for comment  - ctrl + /



# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:


#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")



# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

# Syntax for multiline string comment - """ Content """ or ''' Content '''

""" 
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line 
"""


# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
