# The while Loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

i=1
while i<6:
    print(i)
    i+=1



# The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

print("Count : ")
count=0
while count<5:
    print(count)
    count+=1



# Infinite Loop in Python :

while True:
    print("It will run till infinity")
