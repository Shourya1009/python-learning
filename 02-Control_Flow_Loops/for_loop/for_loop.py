# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.



# Syntax of for loop in python :-

    # for i(variable name can be anything) in range(built-in function)(satrting term , n-1th term) 


# Print 1 to 10 using for loop

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
 


# Print table of 5 using for loop 

for x in range(1,11):
    print("5 * " , x , " = " , 5*(x))
